# RK-23 Keyboard

## Overview

This project has been my first exposure to the Web Audio API. I initially thought that dealing with sound in the browser would be similar to visuals... this was not the case.

My very first instrument was this toy keyboard by Casio:

I thought that making something like this in the browser would be a great chance to gain familiarity and cover the basics.

## Final Product

Check out the live page [here](https://nchau3.github.io/RK-23-Keyboard/) (best viewed on desktop)!

At the time of release, the finished product has the following features:

- 3 distinct voices (organ, clarinet, accordion)
- gain slider
- octave switch
- mouse and keyboard inputs
- midi functionality (courtesy of [Zach Shilton](https://github.com/zchsh))

Getting all of working presented a lot of unique challenges, especially in synthesizing the voices and getting them to sound pleasing.

Very excited about refining the voice creation process, incorporating rhythm/recording and exploring possibilities for working with sound in games or education apps.

Stay tuned for updates to this README where I'll be expanding on how I approached sound generation in the browser!
